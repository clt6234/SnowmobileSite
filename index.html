		<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
		<p>     Our team is built up of 25 plus individuals of various majors 
		from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science to Graphic Design. Eric
		Oswald our team’s Lead Engine Designer is a 3rd year Mechanical 
		Engineering Technology major who joined our team because he is 
		passionate about snowmobiles, engines, and green technology. 
		Jason Ganje a 2nd year Electro/Mechanical Engineering Technology major 
		and our team’s Team Manager stated “I grew up riding four wheelers and
		I want my grand kids to experience powersports in the future.” The rest
		of our team has a strong passion for powersports and are interested in 
		putting in their part to help conserve our environment and national 
		parks. 
		
		Our team was founded in the fall of 2012 by four fearless Engineering 
		students, Mark Menzenski, John Bulzacchelli, Zack Kraenzle, and Tom 
		Mordovancey. Polaris Industries donated a snowmobile chassis and a four 
		stroke engine and we were tasked to make it work. Unfortunately, due to
		lack of funds and available space, the team was not able to get the 
		snowmobile running properly for the 2013 and 2014 Clean Snowmobile 
		Challenge. For the 2015 competition our team was able to compete and 
		placed 12th. Our momentum for the 2016 competition was greater than ever
		and we were able to place 10th, as well as bringing back an emissions
		analyser from Horiba.</p>

		<h2>What Do We Do?</h2>
		<p>		 The main goal of the team is to make a snowmobile that is more
		environmentally friendly than the stock snowmobiles currently on the
		market. We begin with a stock snowmobile, and from there re-engineer
		everything from what engine we put into it all the way down to the size
		of the track that we want to have on it. </p>

		<h2>About The Competition</h2>
		<p> To show you how the Clean Snowmobile Challenge was started, we will 
		go back to the mid 1990’s where Yellowstone National Park was a major 
		attraction for snowmobilers, where about 90,000 people visited by 
		snowmobile each winter. In the year 2000 the National Park Service 
		banned snowmobiles in Yellowstone due to snowmobiles causing damage to 
		the park’s wildlife, air quality, and natural soundscapes. In the year
		2003 snowmobiles were allowed back into the park, but a limited number
		of snowmobiles could be let in, they had to be lead by a guide, and 
		had to be of the Best Available Technology (BAT). The Clean 
		Snowmobile Challenge was also created in 2003 to help create quiet and
		clean burning snowmobiles for pristine areas like Yellowstone.     </p>
